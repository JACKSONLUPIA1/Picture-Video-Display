Picture/Video Display

Navbar - 
  Clicking on the "About Me" goes down and shows the about me text box.
  Clicking on the "Content" goes down to the four images.

JS - 
  Clicking view image on each button on the carousel enlarges the image.
  There 'sometimes' is a bug on clicking the "Click me to view" on the content in which I don't have the mental capacity to fix.
  
Images/CSS - 
  Any image that is not found is a placeholder for a logo.
  I don't think I have to say this but I don't own any of these images.
