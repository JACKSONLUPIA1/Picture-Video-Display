Picture/Video Display

Navbar - 
  Clicking on the "About Me" goes down and shows the about me text box.
  Clicking on the "Content" goes down to the four images.

JS - 
  Clicking view image on each button on the carousel enlarges the image.
  There 'sometimes' is a bug on clicking the "Click me to view" on the content in which I don't have the mental capacity to fix.
